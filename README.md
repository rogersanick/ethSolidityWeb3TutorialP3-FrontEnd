# React Dapp Basic Decentralized Lottery

In this project, I built a decentralized lottery application using web3.js, solidity and React. Building this application was part of the course content for [this](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/content) udemy course.

## Getting Started
